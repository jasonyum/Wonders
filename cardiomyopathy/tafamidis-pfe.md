## Summary 

### Methods
> In a multicenter, international, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 441 patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy in a 2:1:2 ratio to receive 80 mg of tafamidis, 20 mg of tafamidis, or placebo for 30 months. In the primary analysis, we hierarchically assessed all-cause mortality, followed by frequency of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations according to the Finkelstein–Schoenfeld method. Key secondary end points were the change from baseline to month 30 for the 6-minute walk test and the score on the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire–Overall Summary (KCCQ-OS), in which higher scores indicate better health status.

### Results
> In the primary analysis, all-cause mortality and rates of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations were lower among the 264 patients who received tafamidis than among the 177 patients who received placebo (P<0.001). Tafamidis was associated with lower all-cause mortality than placebo (78 of 264 [29.5%] vs. 76 of 177 [42.9%]; hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51 to 0.96) and a lower rate of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations, with a relative risk ratio of 0.68 (0.48 per year vs. 0.70 per year; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.81). At month 30, tafamidis was also associated with a lower rate of decline in distance for the 6-minute walk test (P<0.001) and a lower rate of decline in KCCQ-OS score (P<0.001). The incidence and types of adverse events were similar in the two groups.

## Takeaways: 
- The results show strong evidence that Tafamidis provides a mortality benefit (HR = 0.7).
- Primary endpoint reached (p<0.001).
- The results do not seem to show a dose response (higher 80mg dosage didn't create difference). 
- Negative for EIDX since they argue for more stabilizers.
- Positive for ALNY since tafamidis didn't hit statistical significant in ATTR mutant patients.

## Discussion & Notes: 
> There are more than 120 pathogenic mutations in TTR that result in a variable phenotypic presentation.2,3 Although the prevalence of ATTRwt is uncertain, studies that use an approach to diagnosis that is not based on biopsy4,5 have reported a prevalence of 13% among patients with heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction,6 16% among patients undergoing transcatheter aortic-valve replacement for severe aortic stenosis,7 and 5% among patients with presumed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.8 Treatments have been limited to supportive care, with no guideline-recommended treatment. Median survival in untreated patients is reported to be 2.5 years after diagnosis for ATTRm caused by the TTR Val122Ile mutation and 3.6 years for ATTRwt.9,10 Death in most patients is from cardiac causes, including sudden death and heart failure.

- Median survival is 2.5 years for ATTRm (mutation).
- Median survival is 3.6 years for ATTwt (wild-type). 

> Transthyretin is a 127-amino acid, 55-kD protein that is primarily synthesized in the liver and transports thyroxine and retinol-binding protein-retinol (vitamin A) complex.11,12 Fibrillogenesis occurs when the tetrameric structure of the transthyretin protein dissociates into intermediates, which misassemble into soluble oligomers, protofilaments, and amyloid fibrils.13 Kelly and colleagues discovered that a polymorphism in TTR that encodes the amino-acid substitution Thr119Met stabilized the protein in the context of a destabilizing pathogenic variant (Val30Met), leading to the development of tafamidis,14,15 a benzoxazole derivative lacking nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug activity that binds to the thyroxine-binding sites of transthyretin with high affinity and selectivity and inhibits the dissociation of tetramers into monomers. Tafamidis has been shown to slow the progression of peripheral neurologic impairment in transthyretin amyloid polyneuropathy.16

- The dissociation of the protein misassembles into soluble oligomers, protofilaments, and amyloid fibrils. 
- A polymorphism in TTR that encodes the amino-acid substitituion stabilized the protein. 

> Patients were randomly assigned to receive 80 mg of tafamidis, 20 mg of tafamidis, or matching placebo once daily in ratio of a 2:1:2. Stratification was conducted according to TTR status (variant or wild type) and baseline NYHA class. An interactive Web-response system was used. The trial duration was 30 months, and on completion patients were offered enrollment in an extension study. Patients who had adverse events that may have been associated with treatment and may have affected adherence to the dosing regimen or continued participation in the trial were given the option to receive a reduced dose (patients receiving a dose of 80 mg would instead receive a dose of 40 mg, and all others continued to receive the dose assigned at randomization).

- 2:1:2 ratio split between 80mg: 20mg: placebo. 
- If you had an adverse reaction, you were brought to a 40mg dose. 

> We hierarchically assessed all-cause mortality, followed by frequency of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations over the course of the 30-month trial. This analysis compared the results of a pooled tafamidis (80 mg and 20 mg) treatment group with the placebo group. Key secondary end points were change from baseline to month 30 in both distance walked on the 6-minute walk test,20 a measure of functional capacity, and the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire–Overall Summary (KCCQ-OS) score,21 which assesses quality of life. Scores range from 0 to 100, with lower scores denoting poorer quality of life. Vital status at month 30 was assessed for all enrolled patients.

- 30-month trial, pooled tafamidis (80 mg and 20 mg) treatment against placebo group. 
- Primary endpoint was all-cause mortality benefit.
- Secondary endpoints are a walking test and a questionnaire. 

## Statistical Analysis 
> A sample size of 400 patients was estimated to give the trial power of at least 90% to detect a 30% reduction in mortality, a reduction in the frequency of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations from 2.5 to 1.5 (over the 30-month duration of the trial), or both given treatment with tafamidis. Our trial population was targeted to comprise at least 30% of patients with ATTRm and at least 30% with ATTRwt. Comparisons were based on the pooled tafamidis treatment groups of 80 mg and 20 mg versus placebo, except for specific dose comparisons. In the primary analysis, we hierarchically assessed all-cause mortality, followed by frequency of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations with the use of the Finkelstein–Schoenfeld method,22 which is based on the principle that each patient in the clinical trial is compared with every other patient within each stratum in a pairwise manner. This method gives a higher importance to all-cause mortality. The pairwise comparison proceeds in hierarchical fashion, using all-cause mortality, followed by frequency of cardiovascular-related hospitalization when patients cannot be differentiated on the basis of mortality. In the analysis of frequency of cardiovascular-related hospitalization, when two patients had different follow-up times, the shorter follow-up time was used in comparing the frequency of their cardiovascular-related hospitalizations.

- Finkelstein-Schoenfeld method: based on principle that each patient in the clinical trial is compared with every other patient within each stratum in a *pairwise manner*. This memthod *gives a higher importance to all-cause mortality*.

> We applied the Finkelstein–Schoenfeld method to the patients stratified according to NYHA class at baseline (class I or II vs. class III) and TTR status (variant vs. wild-type), yielding four stratification pools. Heart transplantation, heart and liver transplantation, and implantation of a mechanical cardiac-assist device were treated as death for the purposes of this analysis. Only one patient underwent liver transplantation alone, and this event was not treated as a death. All-cause mortality was analyzed with the use of a Cox proportional-hazards model, with treatment and the stratification factors treated as covariates.

- Heart transplants or cardiac-assist devices were treated as death. 

> We compared the frequency of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations with the use of a Poisson regression model, with treatment, TTR status (variant and wild type), NYHA baseline class (NYHA classes I and II combined vs. NYHA class III), treatment-by-TTR status interaction, and treatment-by-NYHA baseline class interaction terms as factors, with adjustment for treatment duration. The key secondary end points were assessed with the use of a mixed-effect model, repeated-measure approach and analysis of covariance,23 with an unstructured covariance matrix. Center and patient-within-center were treated as random effects, and treatment, visit, TTR status (ATTRm vs. ATTRwt), and visit-by-treatment interaction were treated as fixed effects, with the baseline value as covariate. A prespecified hierarchical testing order (the 6-minute walk test, followed by the KCCQ-OS) provided multiplicity protection against type 1 error. The remaining secondary and exploratory analyses and end points were not adjusted for multiplicity.

- Frequency of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations = Poisson regression model
- Secondary end points were assessed using a mixed-effect model with an unstructured covariance matrix.
