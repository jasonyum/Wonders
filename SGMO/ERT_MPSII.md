## Long-term experience with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in MPS II patients with a severe phenotype: an international case series
See link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4158409/pdf/10545_2014_Article_9686.pdf

### Abstract
> A retrospective chart review.... One of 22 patients experienced improvements in seven
somatic signs/symptoms; 17/22 experienced improvements in
five to six somatic signs/symptoms; and 4/22 experienced improvements
in four somatic signs/symptoms. None experienced
fewer than four improvements. No new safety concerns arose.
Infusion-related reactions were experienced by 4/22 patients but
were successfully managed using accepted strategies.

Conclusion: Basically, the enzyme replacement therapy from Shire (Elaprase) works. The reason why I think this is an interesting retrospective is because they track the urinary GAG levels. Result found: "a decrease in uGAG levels compared with baseline was observed in 20/22 (91%) patients, with decreases ranging from 22% to 97%. Notably, patient 6 + 14 did not have baseline test results, so their percent change is from the first test to the last available test result rather than a normalized baseline.

> Urinary GAGs are a useful endpoint in order to observe the
biochemical effects of idursulfase treatment. Urinary GAG
levels were generally reduced on ERT, with 91 % of patients
experiencing a decrease in uGAG levels as compared with
baseline (Fig. 1). Two patients experienced an increase in
uGAG levels while receiving idursulfase, but this increase
did not clearly correspond with ADA, as patient 14 was
ADA positive and patient 16 was ADA negative. Both patients
experienced four or more somatic improvements on
ERT despite increased uGAG levels. It is possible that these
patientsâ€™ measurements may have been misleading, as individual
uGAG measurements vary from day to day and even at
different times during the day. The picture is somewhat more
complicated for patient 14, who lacks baseline data and whose
earliest uGAG test was performed after 6 months of ERT. The
result at that point was nearly normal (7.86 mg/mmol creatinine;
ULN: 7.70 mg/mmol creatinine). Thus, data from patient
14 should be considered with caution.

- Useful to look at uGAGs to determine biochemical effects of idursulfase (the enzyme replacement therapy). 
- You can see that people who are treated and see strong benefits have demonstrably lower uGAGs. 
- So the natural question becomes, how does SGMO do when it comes to uGAG decreases? 
- The data is only on two people in cohort 2, so there's plenty of room for error, but there appears to be a reduction in uGAG levels.

- This is important for SGMO, because they are reporting lower uGAG levels but there's no detectable enzyme in the blood.

- That said, is there a **clear** clinical link between lowering uGAGs and helping people with MPS II? 

And the logic here is that you'd think there is, but maybe there's room for error here, too. The reason why they're a natural place to look .. is that MPS II is a progressive disease that is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme iduronate-2 sulfatase (I2S). Lacking this enzyme leads to **an accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate in lysosomes.** Excessive storage of these GAGS causes a variety of clinical problems like cardiac valve disease, restrictive and obstructive airway disease, recurrent upper respieratory infections, skeletal abnormalities, etc. Hence, you want to track the GAGs in some way, an easy way to do it is through the urine, aka looking at the uGAGs. 

*Counterpoint*: still according to the Barclays KOL, "she reiterated that there were *no clear correlations between uGAG reduction and clinical improvements in MPS II patients* ... in addition, there remain open questions on the origin of urine GAGs and inherent variability in their measurements."

- I'm not sure how there can be no "clear correlation" when there's a correlation in the study included in this paper. The people were largely helped by the enzyme replacement therapy (clinical benefit) and at the same time they saw their uGAGs reduced. That suggests correlation.
