### Next Steps

- Better competitive analysis, QURE, ONCE, BMRN 
- TAM, timing of when it could happen

- We need to understand T-Regs better.
- We also need to include notes from the Barclays meeting. 
- What are all the ways that we could lose? 
- What other genetic therapies are being approved? Look at SRPT

- Need to be able to point to the partnership agreements and understand risks better.


# High Priority
- Figure out why HIV did not work for SGMO.
- If HIV is CCR5... then it should've worked.
