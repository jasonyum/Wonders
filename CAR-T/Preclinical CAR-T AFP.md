# Targetting Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP)-MHC Complex with CAR T-Cell Therapy for Liver Cancer

> Purpose: The majority of tumor-specific antigens are intracellular
and/or secreted and therefore inaccessible by conventional
chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. Given
that all intracellular/secreted proteins are processed into peptides
and presented by class I MHC on the surface of tumor
cells, we used alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), a specific liver cancer
marker, as an example to determine whether peptideâ€“MHC
complexes can be targets for CAR T-cell therapy against solid
tumors.

It's important to be skeptical of preclinical work, but the paper shows that AFP can be a logical target for CAR T-cell therapy in mice. That shows some potential. The way that CAR T-Cell Therapy works is by "programming" T cells to attack and kill tumor cells expressing a particular antigen. As it stands, however, the use of CAR T has been challenged by insufficient localization and an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Moreover, there are targeting issues. If you go off-target there are often toxicity implications -- **especially if the antigen is *not* unique to the tumor cell**. 

AFP is not completely understood, but it's been associated with cell proliferation and apoptosis suppression. 


### Definitions: 
- antigen: molecule capable of inducing an immune response in the host organism (bacteria, fungi, viruses are all antigens). Antigens are "targeted" by antibodies. 
- intracellular: "within" a cell
- chimeric antigen receptors: receptors that graft a monoclonal antibody onto a T cell. They are called "chimeric" because they are created from different sources. They're recombinant receptors that combine antigen-binding and T-cell functions. T-cells are removed from a person's blood, and then re-engineered and then re-introduced into the patient so that this chimeric antigen receptor (augmented, programmed, "living drug" T-cell) can then attack the cancer cell. 
- palliative care: helps with the pain but doesn't deal with the root cause
- apoptosis: cell death
